## bloch_vector

- A simple application to overview how Bloch vectors change when rotations are applied to quantum states.

- What you can learn:
  - How to create the corresponding Bloch vector from a quantum state
  - How to visualize a Bloch vector on a Bloch sphere
  - How to implement in NumPy and in Qiskit and view their comparison

## grover

- A simple application using Grover's algorithm

- What you can learn:
  - How to create an operator from a unitary matrix representation and compose it to an existing circuit
  - How to create an oracle by giving the solution as a list of strings
  - How to check state vectors in TeX mathematical notation
  - How to apply Grover's algorithm for multiple solutions
